MODEL A DECK OF CARDS
=====================

In this assignment, since i am mostly design oriented, I mainly changed the design and layout of the website. I used OOCSS and the grid layout (skeleton) to arrange my site in an orderly fashion. I used photoshop on the title, buttons and cards to make it more appealing. I placed the Javascript into a seperate file and linked it to the html file. I apologize for the pictures inside the root folder. I tried putting it in a seperate folder and changing the path names in the html file but it seemed like it was unable to find the files.I had trouble trying to curve the edges on the buttons possibly due to the structure of the input element. I also was unable to change the color and font of the "score" and "current hand" text. If there is a solution please let me know.
